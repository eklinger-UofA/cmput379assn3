Now more back story

DEFEND TERRA OR PERISH

The evil alien invaders are coming to get us, and all we have is one cannon to fire at them.

You only have 5 rockets to start (since we aren't very prepared)

If more than 5 ships get past our defences we are doomed.

Best of luck, and no pressure right ;)
